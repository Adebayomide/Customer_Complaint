# Introduction:

Welcome to the Customer Service Complaint Analysis project! In this repository, you will find an in-depth exploration of customer complaints, their distribution across states, yearly trends, and various types of requests. Through interactive visualizations created using Tableau, we aim to provide valuable insights into the world of customer service complaints and empower organizations to enhance their customer satisfaction levels.

# Overview:

This project delves into a comprehensive analysis of customer complaints in the realm of customer service. By leveraging data visualization techniques in Tableau, we have uncovered intriguing patterns, trends, and relationships that can shed light on the challenges faced by businesses and guide them towards effective solutions.

# Dataset 

For this project, I will be using the datasets - Customer Complaint Full Data and State Map Full.

# Dashboard :

# Key Insights:


**Total Complaints:** Gain an understanding of the overall volume of complaints, allowing organizations to evaluate their service quality and identify areas of improvement.

**Complaints per State**: Explore the distribution of complaints across different states. Identify regions with high complaint rates, enabling targeted interventions to enhance customer satisfaction at a regional level.

**Yearly Trend of Complaints**: Analyze the annual trajectory of complaints over time. Uncover patterns, spikes, and dips to identify seasonal trends or changes in customer behavior. Such insights can aid in resource allocation and preemptive measures.

**Types of Requests:** Dive into the breakdown of complaints by request types, including web, phone, and email. This analysis offers a glimpse into customer preferences and highlights the channels through which they express their concerns.

**Percentage of Complaints per Year:** Observe the proportion of complaints attributed to different years. Identify if certain years experienced a surge or decline in complaints, allowing organizations to investigate potential underlying causes.

**Product Filters:** Utilize interactive product filters to focus on specific complaint categories, such as bank services (checkings) and others (student loans, vehicle loans, debt collections). This segmentation enables targeted analysis and tailored strategies for addressing specific product-related issues.

**Conclusion:**

Through this Customer Service Complaint Analysis project, we have provided a comprehensive understanding of customer complaints, their distribution, and underlying trends. By leveraging the power of Tableau, organizations can harness these insights to optimize their customer service processes, identify pain points, and proactively enhance customer satisfaction levels.

I hope that this analysis serves as a valuable resource for organizations seeking to improve their customer service practices.
